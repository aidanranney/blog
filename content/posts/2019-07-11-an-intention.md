This site is meant to be a place where I can write about software. This might include general thoughts and opinions, however it will mainly showcase whatever it is I'm interested in and learning about currently. I hope that in the future I'll continue to build out this site as a learning exercise. Ideally, it will serve as a kind of learning journal and a portfolio at the same time.


I should also note that this site is being built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), a static PWA generator, using React and GraphQL. Kyle A Matthew's [Blog Starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/) for Gatsby has been used as a guide, along with the official API docs.
